## 💡 Advertising Concept

The core idea is **horizontal ad banners** that act as mini-advertisements for each store's current sales page or promotion. Each banner includes:

1. **Store identity & sale tag** (e.g., "LIMITED TIME", "SEASONAL SALE")
2. **Bold headline** with gradient text showing the discount
3. **Brief copy** highlighting key brands and the sale's value proposition
4. **Direct CTA button** linking to the store's actual sale page
5. **Interactive pointer-following glow** that tracks the user's cursor across the banner
6. **Floating visual elements** with hover animations

This format can be easily extended for any new store or brand collaboration.
